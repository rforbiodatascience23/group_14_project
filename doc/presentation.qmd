## Introduction

-   Dataset: South African male heart-disease sample.

    ![Fig1: Data set](../results/data%20set.png){width="615"}

## Aim and Method
### Aim

-   There are roughly two control per case of CHD

-   Many CHD positive patients have gone under blood pressure reduction

-   Our aim is to analyse the correlation between CHD and the causes

### Material

-   R studio, Github

-   R libraries such as tiddy, purr, ggplot and many more


## Method

## Loading and Cleaning the Data

-   Downloaded from the source as .txt file
-   Randomly replace cells with NA values
-   Saved as loaded.csv
-   02_clean.qmd removes NAs and "row.names" column

## Augmentation
- Convert "famhist" to numerical variable: 1 for present, 0 for absent.
- Transform "age" into "age_interval" with specified intervals (e.g., 0-20, 20-40).
- Introduce "weight_status" variable based on obesity criteria.
- Include "alcohol_status" variable reflecting alcohol consumption levels.
- Create "exercise_habits" variable based on type and age.
- Add "hered" variable to indicate inherited disease status (yes/no).

## Description
- Provide summary statistics for numeric variables.
- Determine the count of each unique value for the 'famhist' variable.
- Calculate the count of each unique combination of 'famhist' and 'chd' variables.
- Investigate the distribution of each numerical variable individually.

- Examine the distribution of each categorical variable separately.

## Analysis

## PCA

- PCA analysis was carried out on the numeric columns
- No clear separation is observed
- No major feature reduction

## Result-Model

-   Multiple linear regression was performed on the augmented dataset

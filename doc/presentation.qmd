## Introduction

-   Dataset: South African male heart-disease sample.

    ![Fig1: Data set](../results/data%20set.png){width="615"}

## Aim and Method

### Aim

-   There are roughly two control per case of CHD

-   Many CHD positive patients have gone under blood pressure reduction

-   Our aim is to analyse the correlation between CHD and the causes

### Material

-   R studio, Github

-   R libraries such as tiddy, purr, ggplot and many more

## Method

## Loading and Cleaning the Data

-   Downloaded from the source as .txt file
-   Randomly replace cells with NA values
-   Saved as loaded.csv
-   02_clean.qmd removes NAs and "row.names" column

## Augmentation

-   Convert "famhist" to numerical variable: 1 for present, 0 for absent.
-   Transform "age" into "age_interval" with specified intervals (e.g., 0-20, 20-40).
-   Introduce "weight_status" variable based on obesity criteria.
-   Include "alcohol_status" variable reflecting alcohol consumption levels.
-   Create "exercise_habits" variable based on type and age.
-   Add "hered" variable to indicate inherited disease status.

## Description


-   Provide summary statistics for numeric variables.

## PCA

-   PCA analysis was carried out on the numeric columns
-   No clear separation is observed

-   No major feature reduction

## Result-Model

-   Multiple linear regression was performed on the augmented dataset

## Introduction

-   Dataset: South African male heart-disease sample.

    ![Fig1: Data set](../results/data%20set.png){width="615"}

## Aim and Method
### Aim

-   There are roughly two control per case of CHD

-   Many CHD positive patients have gone under blood pressure reduction

-   Our aim is to analyse the correlation between CHD and the causes

### Material

-   R studio, Github

-   R libraries such as tiddy, purr, ggplot and many more


## Method

## Loading and Cleaning the Data

-   Downloaded from the source as .txt file
-   Randomly replace cells with NA values
-   Saved as loaded.csv
-   02_clean.qmd removes NAs and "row.names" column

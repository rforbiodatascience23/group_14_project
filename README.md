## Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Lifestyle-based preventative measures are effective, non-invasive ways of reducing the prevalence of CHD, though they rely on good knowledge of the risk factors relevant to a given community. This study investigates the risk factors associated with CHD in three communities of rural Afrikaans-speaking Whites in the south-western Cape, with the aim of revealing the most prominent risk factors.

## Data

The data used in this investigation was collected in a retrospective cohort study, reported in a paper by Rossouw et al. (1), under the following PMID: 6623218.

The following biological variables are included for each study participant:

1.  Age
2.  Systolic blood pressure
3.  Low-density lipoprotein (cholesterol)
4.  Adiposity
5.  BMI
6.  Coronary heart disease diagnosis
7.  Family history of coronary heart disease

The following behavioral indicators are included for each study participant:

1.  Current tobacco consumption
2.  Current alcohol consumption
3.  Personality type (type A vs type B)
